Let me tell you something,\
About your Dad,\
Let me whisper,\
A secret,

There is nothing,\
He won't do for you,\
He thinks about you,\
All the time,

He works so hard for you,\
For his family,\
He wants you to have,\
The very best in life,\

He just wants you,\
To be happy,\
That is why he takes,\
Care of us,

So let's make sure,\
That he knows,\
We appreciate him,\
We love him too.\

La hermosa poesía que me regaló My Beautty sobre nuestra Little Baby Bymp.
